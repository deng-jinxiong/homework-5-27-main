Items can be cloned with the following command:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/deng-jinxiong/homework-5-27-main.git

Before running a project on a local PC, install the visualize package, and add environment variables.

## Part 2. Bags and DataFrames

In the process of operation, a concurrent scheme is adopted to optimize the operation, and the operation speed of large data sets is accelerated through the synchronous operation of multiple data sets.
